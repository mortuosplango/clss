clss


a little step sequencer built in sdl

it can't do much, but also fucks up the timing if a lot of samples are playing

to use:

 - install lispbuilder https://code.google.com/p/lispbuilder/
 - follow the instructions in clss.lisp
 - click on the sample name at the end of a row to change the sample
 - click on a round thing to change the state of a note (on or off)
 - [esc] to stop the application


planned features:
 - [ ] osc support
 - [ ] better timing
 - [ ] unicorns
